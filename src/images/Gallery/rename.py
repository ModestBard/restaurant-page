# 1. The script imports necessary modules: `os`, `Path` from `pathlib`, and `logging`.

# 2. A `setup_logging()` function is defined to configure basic logging settings.

# 3. The main functionality is in the `rename_jpg_files()` function:
#    - It uses the current working directory to find JPG files.
#    - It searches for files with extensions .jpg, .JPG, .jpeg, and .JPEG.
#    - Duplicate files are removed from the list.
#    - If no JPG files are found, it displays a warning message.
#    - It prints the list of found JPG files and asks for user confirmation before proceeding.
#    - Files are renamed to a numerical sequence (e.g., 1.jpg, 2.jpg, etc.).
#    - The script handles potential naming conflicts and logs any errors during the renaming process.

# 4. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block:
#    - Sets up logging.
#    - Calls the `rename_jpg_files()` function.
#    - Keeps the console window open after execution (useful when run by double-clicking).

# 5. Throughout the script, there are various error handling and logging statements to capture and report any issues that may occur during execution.

# This script provides a user-friendly way to batch rename JPG files in a directory to a numerical sequence, with built-in safeguards and error handling.
